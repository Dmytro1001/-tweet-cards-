The Tweet Cards app is a tool that allows users to create visually appealing
Twitter cards for their tweets. These cards can include custom background
images, text, and links, and are designed to grab the viewer's attention and
encourage engagement with the tweet.

Here's a brief description of the frameworks and libraries that were used in
Tweet Cards:

- "@emotion/react" and "@emotion/styled" are a popular CSS-in-JS library that
  allows developers to write CSS styles as JavaScript code. This makes it easy
  to create and manage dynamic styles that respond to changes in state or user
  input.

- "@testing-library/jest-dom", "@testing-library/react", and
  "@testing-library/user-event" are testing libraries that provide utilities for
  testing React components and their behavior. These libraries help ensure that
  the application functions as expected and catches any potential issues before
  deploying to production.

- "ky" is a lightweight library for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. It
  provides a simple and consistent API for working with network requests.

- "react" and "react-dom" are the core libraries for building React
  applications. They provide the basic building blocks for creating UI
  components, managing state, and rendering the application to the DOM.

- "react-icons" is a library of popular icons that can be easily used in React
  applications. It provides a convenient way to add icons to the application
  without having to create them from scratch.

- "react-loader-spinner" is a library that provides a collection of loading
  spinners that can be used in React applications. These spinners indicate to
  the user that the application is loading or processing data.

- "react-router-dom" is a library that provides tools for handling client-side
  routing in React applications. It allows developers to create multiple pages
  or views within a single-page application.

- "react-scripts" is a set of scripts and configurations that are used to build,
  test, and deploy React applications. It provides a consistent and reliable
  development environment for working with React.

- "web-vitals" is a library that provides tools for measuring and reporting key
  performance metrics for web applications. It helps developers identify areas
  where the application can be optimized for better performance.
